# WaxHandballFrontend

# Project History
The project was made in a combined asp.net - angular project with SPA Proxy, then it was separated into a frontend and backend (Backend repository: https://github.com/KuraiZoltan/WaxHandballBackend).
Basic implementation/view was made before the separation, further developments are being made.

#
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.
